# Banking System

This is a simple C++ Banking System project that simulates basic banking operations such as:
- Account Creation
- Deposit and Withdrawal
- Balance Enquiry
- Account Management (Open and Close Accounts)

## Technologies Used:
- **C++** for implementation.
- **File handling** using `fstream` for data persistence.

## How to Run the Project:
1. Compile the `banking_system.cpp` file using any C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Follow the on-screen options to perform banking operations.

## Features:
- Minimum balance requirement (`MIN_BALANCE = 500`).
- File-based persistence for account information.
